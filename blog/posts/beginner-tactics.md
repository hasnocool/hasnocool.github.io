# Top 10 War Thunder Tactics for Beginners

Welcome to the thrilling world of War Thunder! If you're just starting out, the sheer complexity of the game can be overwhelming. Don't worry – we've got you covered with these top 10 tactics that will help you survive and thrive in your early battles.

## 1. Master Your Controls

Before diving into combat, spend time in the test flight mode to familiarize yourself with your aircraft's controls. Practice basic maneuvers like turning, climbing, and diving. The better you know your controls, the more instinctive your reactions will be in combat.

## 2. Start with Arcade Battles

While Realistic and Simulator battles offer a more immersive experience, Arcade battles are perfect for beginners. They're more forgiving, with simplified flight models and helpful indicators. Use this mode to learn the basics of dogfighting and target acquisition.

## 3. Know Your Aircraft

Each plane in War Thunder has its strengths and weaknesses. Some are great turners, others are fast climbers. Learn your aircraft's strong points and play to them. For example, if you're flying a heavy fighter, avoid turning fights with more agile opponents.

## 4. Altitude is Your Friend

In air combat, height often equals advantage. Climb at the start of the match to gain an altitude advantage. This gives you potential energy, better visibility, and the ability to dive on enemies below you.

## 5. Use Cover in Ground Battles

If you're playing ground forces, always be thinking about cover. Use buildings, hills, and even the corpses of destroyed vehicles to protect yourself from enemy fire. Remember, staying alive is the first step to victory!

## 6. Aim for Critical Components

When attacking enemy vehicles, aim for critical components:
- For aircraft: engines, wings, or pilot
- For tanks: gunner, driver, or ammo rack
- For ships: ammunition storage or engines

Disabling these can quickly take an enemy out of the fight.

## 7. Situational Awareness is Key

Always keep an eye on your surroundings. Use your camera controls to look around constantly. In air battles, an enemy you don't see is far more dangerous than one you do.

## 8. Manage Your Ammo and Energy

Don't spray and pray – make your shots count. Similarly, manage your aircraft's energy in air battles. A plane with no speed or altitude is a sitting duck.

## 9. Communicate with Your Team

War Thunder is a team game. Use the quick commands (by default, pressing T) to inform your teammates about enemies, request help, or coordinate attacks. Good communication can turn the tide of battle.

## 10. Learn from Every Death

Instead of getting frustrated when you're shot down, try to understand why. Watch the replay from your killer's perspective. What did they do right? What did you do wrong? Every defeat is a learning opportunity.

## Bonus Tip: Keep Upgrading

As you play, you'll earn research points. Use these to upgrade your vehicles. Even small improvements can make a big difference in battle.

## Conclusion

Remember, becoming skilled at War Thunder takes time and practice. Don't get discouraged if you struggle at first – we all do! Keep these tactics in mind, stay patient, and before you know it, you'll be climbing the ranks and dominating the battlefield.
