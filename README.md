# Project Title: **Responsive Menu System**

A highly customizable and accessible menu system designed to be used on various devices and screen sizes.

## Description
I built this project to create a robust and flexible menu system that can adapt to different screen resolutions, devices, and user interactions. The goal is to provide an intuitive navigation experience for users while keeping the design responsive and visually appealing.

## Features

* **Modular Design**: The menu system consists of individual components (items) that can be combined to create a unique layout.
* **Responsive Grid**: Utilizes CSS Grid to create a dynamic layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
* **Customizable Appearance**: Allows users to adjust colors, typography, and other visual elements through variables.
* **Accessibility**: Incorporates features like high contrast mode, large text size, and clear labels for improved accessibility.

One cool feature is the ability to use CSS counters to display a dynamic menu item number. This creates an elegant and scalable solution for complex menus.

## Installation

To get started with this project, simply:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.
3. Explore the menu system and adjust variables as needed (see below).

**Variables:**

* `--color-item-alt`: Change the color of menu items on hover.
* `--color-link-hover`: Modify the background color of menu item links.

## Usage

The project consists of several HTML files, each containing a specific component or layout. To build upon this project:

1. Create new HTML files for your custom layouts.
2. Copy and paste existing components (e.g., `.menu__item`) to create new instances.
3. Update variables as needed to match your desired design.
